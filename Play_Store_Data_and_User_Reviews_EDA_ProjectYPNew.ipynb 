        "***1. Top categories on Google Playstore?***\n",
        "• From above visualizaion we can say that we used to make an informed decision to target a category, which is popular among user and not having a lot of apps listed in Google Playstore.\n",
        "***2. Which category App's have most number of installs?***\n",
        "If we compare chart the charts we can see that although the most number of apps present in playstore belongs to categories like Family, Game, Tool, Business, Medical. However, the most installed apps belong to categories like Game, Communication, Tools, Productivity &, Social.\n",
        "Hence we can see that categories where comparatively less number of app are present but they are more popular among users (categories like Communication & Social) can be targeted for future business expansion purpose.\n",
        "***3. Percentage of Review Sentiments ***We get below information through our visualization.\n",
        "1. Approx 64.21% are Positive reviews\n",
        "2. Approx 21.44% are Positive reviews\n",
        "3. Approx 14.35% are Positive reviews\n",
        "We can say that most of the users are happy with the quality and Content of the Apps, considering the fact there are 64.30% review are positive.\n",
        "***4. Which category of Apps from the Content Rating column are found more on playstore?***\n",
        "• From the above plot we can see that Everyone category has the highest number of apps.\n",
        "***5. What portion of the apps in playstore are paid and free?***\n",
        "This information will help business to decide whether they should keep the app free to install and generate revenue from ads and other.\n",
        "***6. What are the top 10 most reviewed App on Play Store app?***\n",
        "One important insight that we can see from this chart that there are 3 Apps in the top 10 which are targeted towrds Teens as their audience.\n",
        "From Chart no. 5 we can see that there are total 1036 apps targeted towards Teens as audience, which is much lesser in number if we see\n",
        "\"Everyone\" category having 7903 Apps, yet 3 of them featured in top 10 reviewed apps. This means there is a lot of potential to grow the business if we can appropriately target Teens as our audience.\n",
        "***7. Histogram of Subjectivity***\n",
        "It can be seen that maximum number of sentiment subjectivity lies between 0.4 to 0.7. From this we can conclude that maximum number of users give reviews to the applications, according to their experience.\n",
        "***8. Do price of the app effects the rating?***\n",
        "We found from above visualization that as the Price increasing the ratings recived seems to decrease even below the average rating in playstore app.\n",
        "***9. It would be interesting to see if there is any relationship between Ratings vs Reviews. Does more number of reviews means more ratings?***\n",
        "From the above plot, we cannot say that there is a relation, it seems that irrespective of the Reviews, the ratings are majorly between 4 and 5, which we also noticed before.\n",
        "Also it is not correct to assume that rating and reviews have a relationship because reviews can be positive or negative and increase in the number of reviews does not show whether, the Reviews are Positive or Negative.\n",
        "***10. What is the distribution of type of reviews in the dataset?***\n",
        "Majority of the genres have high positive sentiments, when compared to neutral and negative ones."
